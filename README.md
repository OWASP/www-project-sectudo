### Sectudo is a Mobile app that aims at imparting simplified Mobile Application Security Learning. ###

**Sectudo** demonstrates the security flaws prone to Mobile apps and their Server-side Web APIs. These security flaws can be seen and practiced in the insecure instance of a demo application present in the app. 

*The details of the flaws along with the step-by-step guide of enumerating them are given in the form of videos.*

Along with security flaws, Sectudo also aims to provide an understanding of its security controls. A separate secure instance of the demo application is present in it, with the necessary security measures in place. The security implementation can be studied by navigating through its different features.

### Learning Modules:
All the security flaws seen in Mobile Apps & APIs have been added as Learning module. Each module has notes on the security flaw, its exploit & mitigation technique. 

### Exploits & Challenges:
Exploit section has been added to explain in detail the steps to be followed to test any security flaw in the app. And there is a challenge with every security flaw for its practical understanding. An insecure demo KYC app has been added for the challenges. It is a live demo app, the credentials to access the demo app can be obtained from the home screen of the Sectudo app. 

### Mitigation Techniques:
A secure version of the demo KYC application having all the security controls is embedded in the app. It is reference in the mitigation section for your practical review. A detailed note on the recommendation is added for each security flaw. 

## To run the app:

* Download latest APK (v1.2) from the folder - "Release" section
* Install the apk on your Android device
* Browse through the learning modules. 
* Visit the exploit section, go through the context and then “try exploit” given at the end of section. 
* Refer to the credentials by clicking on the “key” icon on the home screen of the app.
